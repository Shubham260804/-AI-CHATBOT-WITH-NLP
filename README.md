*DESCRIPTION* :

*Project Title* :  AI CHATBOT WITH NPL using Python

I built this simple chatbot using Python and the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library to explore the fundamentals of natural language processing and conversational AI. This project focuses on rule-based conversation handling, where the chatbot responds to user inputs based on pattern matching using regular expressions.

*Features* :

Greets the user and responds to greetings.

Introduces itself and describes its purpose.

Responds to simple questions like:

"What can you do?"

"Who created you?"

"Where are you?"

Tells light-hearted jokes.

Responds politely to boredom.

Handles unknown inputs with a request to rephrase.

Exits gracefully when the user is done.

*Outcome* :

I created a simple, interactive rule-based chatbot using Python and NLTK that can respond to greetings, questions, and casual conversation. It helped me understand how pattern matching and basic NLP work, serving as a great foundation for building more advanced conversational agents.
